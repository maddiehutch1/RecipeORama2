Recipe O Rama is a recipe app that makes cooking in the kitchen efficient and fun. It allows users to add, edit, and delete recipes, as well as mark them as "Favorites". Users can browse through categories and difficulty leves, and search through recipes based on their titles.

Cannot remember what the third thing was that we needed to turn in besides the code and the rubric.

I remember there being a question as to getting a survey of all who will attend the final in person. If that is what it was, my answer is YES, I will be in class for our final at 7am.


GOOD:
* had a better understanding of SwiftUI principles which made it easier to build the app
* starting to connect the dots with how the MVVM connects with one another (I can tell my understanding has improved a ton compared to the beginning of the semester or even when working on Project 1)
* really appreciated the direction/guidance given during the last couple of class periods to understand the thought process behind building an app

BAD:
* might have made it harder for me to work with the categories data (made it a string rather than another class / table)
* working with complex functions was tough to try to follow / understand
