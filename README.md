Cannot remember what the third thing was that we needed to turn in besides the code and the rubric.

I remember there being a question as to getting a survey of all who will attend the final in person. If that is what it was, my answer is YES, I will be in class for our final at 7am.


GOOD:
* had a better understanding of SwiftUI principles which made it easier to build the app
* starting to connect the dots with how the MVVM connects with one another (I can tell my understanding has improved a ton compared to the beginning of the semester or even when working on Project 1)
* really appreciated the direction/guidance given during the last couple of class periods to understand the thought process behind building an app

BAD:
* might have made it harder for me to work with the categories data (made it a string rather than another class / table)
* working with complex functions was tough to try to follow / understand
